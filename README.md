# Career Specific Portfolio
As you venture out to find a job in the field of your choice you will need to be able to prove that you know how to use the technologies or languages. 

Take a look at this video about a [programming portfolio and creating one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ByJtQ8bv4).

You may not be interested in programming as a job choice and I completely respect that, but the information contained in the short video does have its merits. 

In todays age you need to be able to prove to potential employers that you know how to do some of the work you claim to have experience in. This can be done through digital portfolios. In the case of programming its pretty straight forward and can be a series of coding projects in languages you might find interesting. When it comes to some other career choices it could be a little more difficult, but not impossible. Lets take a few examples.

1. **UI/UX designer**. Lets day you absolutely loved the class on web design and human interface. You dont want to get held down having to learn the programming languages, but like to build and prototype websites. Well as a digital portfolio you can use a number of prototyping software available to create websites potential employers could see as example of your work. This allows them to see that you know how to use the product and how to design the user experience. 
2. **Cyber Security**. With a career in cyber you can go about this a number of ways. You can showcase that you know how to use the tools by writing tutorials. Pen testing software or by creating suites of a combination of open source tools for individuals to download and scan their computers.
3. **IT support**. This could involve working as a level 1 support and doing some minor fixes and debugging of software. This can be showcased by taking a small bug in an open source tool and fixing it. If youre fast enough you can even get it published into the open source tool and have a contribution in github to a large project. This would look great on a resume.
4. **Product manager**. Product managers are responsible for pushing through code and managing the developers working on said project. This requires the use of tools and learning software development lifecycles, such as agile or waterfall. Github has built in tools for project management you can showcase or you can use other software for that.

Take a week to decide what the job you envision applying for requires and lets plan a portfolio to help you achieve that goal. It could be within GitHub or outside of it, but it has to be digital and easily shareable with potential employers. 

Submit a proposal for your digital portfolio and some of the example projects you could do if you dont already have any. If you already have some projects that you could add to it please outline what they are and any pertinent information like coding language used (if applicable).
